## About the Collection

The minerals and rocks in this collection are from Travis Jackson's personal collection, which he started accumulating around 2015. He acquired many of his specimens when he started working for the Mobile Minning Experience, a business under the Geologic Times Corporation. This business provides fun and educational opportunities for children to learn about minerals and rocks. The collection displays but a small portion of Travis Jackson's personal collection that includes more than 20,000 specimens, with around 500 differnt types of different minerals and rocks in their polished and natural forms.

## About the Collector

Travis Jackson is interested in learning about and collecting various kinds of minerals and rocks. As a kid, Travis always picked up interesting rocks he saw wherever he went, begging his parents to fill a bag of tumbled stones at fairs. Travis enjoys working at the Mobile Minning Experience as it provides him the wonderful opportunity to learn and collect more minerals and rocks for his ever growing collection. He hopes to someday organize and display the rest of his collection in order to show off the many kinds of minerals and rocks with their different forms, natural and polished.
